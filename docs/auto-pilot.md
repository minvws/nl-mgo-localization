Autopilot is a script that should help developers to run the project locally without any configuration.

It is a simple script that will install all the dependencies, run the migrations, and start the server.

## Usage

```bash
make autopilot
```

Alternatively, you can run the script directly:

```bash
./tools/autopilot.sh
```

Afterwards you can access the project at `http://localhost:8006/docs` . If there are any issues, please ask for help
with the maintainers.
